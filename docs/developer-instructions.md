# Developer Instructions for Portfolio Engine

This document provides detailed instructions and guidelines for AI developers working on the Portfolio Engine project. Use this as a reference to understand the project's goals, priorities, and specific tasks.

## Project Goals

1. **Simplify and Focus**: The project should be streamlined to focus on core features that are well-developed and polished.
2. **Remove Redundancy**: Avoid unnecessary sections or features that do not add significant value.
3. **Enhance Interactivity**: Prioritize interactive and engaging elements that showcase creativity and technical expertise.
4. **Maintain Flexibility**: Ensure the architecture remains modular and extensible for future enhancements.

## Current Priorities

1. **Remove Skills Section**: The skills section has been removed because it implies a limit to learning, which is not accurate. Avoid reintroducing this concept.
2. **Focus on Projects**: The project showcase should be the centerpiece of the portfolio. Add features like interactive previews, detailed descriptions, and dynamic layouts.
3. **Improve Documentation**: Ensure all files are well-documented with clear explanations of their purpose, design, and usage.

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Use ECS Principles**: Follow the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture strictly. Keep data in components, logic in systems, and identity in entities.
2. **Prioritize User Experience**: Design features with the end-user in mind. Ensure the interface is intuitive and visually appealing.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Avoid unnecessary computations or DOM manipulations. Use efficient algorithms and caching where applicable.
4. **Ensure Accessibility**: Follow accessibility standards to make the portfolio usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Tasks for AI Developers

1. **Enhance Project Showcase**:
   - Add support for interactive project previews.
   - Implement a carousel or slide-based navigation for projects.
   - Allow filtering and sorting of projects by technology or type.

2. **Improve Theming System**:
   - Add more themes with unique styles.
   - Allow users to customize themes (e.g., change colors or fonts).

3. **Add Detailed Documentation**:
   - Document all new features and modules.
   - Update this file with any new instructions or priorities.

4. **Optimize Codebase**:
   - Refactor existing code for better readability and maintainability.
   - Remove unused files or dependencies.

## Notes

- Always communicate changes clearly in the documentation.
- Use modular design principles to ensure new features integrate seamlessly.
- Test all changes thoroughly before committing them to the main branch.
