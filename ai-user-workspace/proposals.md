## Notes for AI Assistants

When creating proposals:

1. Use careful consideration before proposing changes to critical files
2. Provide concrete examples when applicable
3. Consider backward compatibility and migration paths
4. Categorize the proposal appropriately by impact level
5. Link to relevant documentation or code samples
6. Include preliminary prototypes when appropriate in the `prototypes/` directory

## Proposal Workflow

1. **Creation:** Create a new proposal using the template above
2. **Review:** Human developers review the proposal
3. **Discussion:** Clarifications and adjustments are made
4. **Decision:** Proposal is approved or rejected
5. **Implementation:** If approved, changes are implemented according to plan
6. **Validation:** Changes are tested and verified
7. **Documentation:** Project documentation is updated to reflect changes
