# PIP-001: Component-Based Event System
=========================================================================

**State**: 🟡 Approved
**Cycle ID**: 1.0.1
**Impacts**: Core/ECS, System Communication, UI Events

## Problem Statement
Our portfolio engine lacks a structured event system that follows ECS principles. Traditional event systems often use callbacks and observer patterns that break the data-oriented approach of ECS. We need a way to handle events that maintains the separation of data (components) and behavior (systems).

## Proposed Solution
Implement a component-based event system where events are treated as entities with specialized components. This approach:

1. Keeps the data-oriented nature of ECS by representing events as data
2. Allows for querying and filtering events just like any other entity
3. Provides a structured way to handle UI events, system communication, and game state changes
4. Enables debugging and visualization of event flow in our DevTools

## Technical Approach
The event system will consist of four main components:

```ascii
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Event Entity   ├────►│  EventSystem    ├────►│  Listener Entity│
│  (with EVENT    │     │  (processes     │     │  (with EVENT_   │
│   component)    │     │   event queue)  │     │   LISTENER comp)│
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

When an event is emitted:
1. A new entity is created
2. An EVENT component is attached with event type and data
3. The EventSystem processes the event during its update cycle
4. Matching listener entities receive EVENT_NOTIFICATION components
5. Systems that operate on notified entities can take appropriate action

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Event Components (1 iteration)
- Define event component schemas
- Create helper functions for component creation
- Implement component registration with ComponentManager

### Phase 2: EventSystem Implementation (1 iteration)
- Create the EventSystem class
- Implement event queue processing
- Add listener entity management
- Support wildcard and prioritized listeners

### Phase 3: Engine Integration (1 iteration)
- Update engine startup to initialize EventSystem 
- Add event handling to World class
- Extend System base class with event helper methods

### Phase 4: Demonstration and Testing (1 iteration)
- Create learning page with event system demo
- Implement visualization of event flow
- Add tests for event handling edge cases

## Expected Outcomes
- Systems can communicate through events in an ECS-compliant way
- UI interactions can be processed as events through the same system
- Events can be easily monitored, debugged, and serialized
- Improved separation of concerns and testability

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance overhead of creating entities for each event | Medium | Medium | Implement event pooling for frequent events |
| Complex event relationships becoming difficult to track | Medium | Medium | Create debugging visualizations in DevTools |
| Learning curve for developers used to traditional event systems | Low | High | Provide clear documentation and examples |

## Conclusion
A component-based event system will maintain the integrity of the ECS architecture while providing powerful event-handling capabilities. This approach treats events as first-class entities in the system, allowing for consistent processing, filtering, and debugging.

The initial implementation will focus on the core functionality needed for basic event handling, with extensions for more complex features (like event history, replay, and advanced filtering) to be added in future iterations.
