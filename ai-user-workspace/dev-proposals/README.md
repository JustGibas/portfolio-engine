# Portfolio Engine Development Proposals
=========================================================================
## Overview
This directory contains Portfolio Improvement Proposals (PIPs) that outline changes, enhancements, and new features for the Portfolio Engine project. Each proposal is documented in a structured format to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Proposal Structure
All proposals should follow this standard format:

```md
# PIP-XXX: Proposal Title

## Implementation Plan
Phased approach with timelines:

### Phase 1: Name (X iterations)
- Key task 1
- Key task 2

### Phase 2: Name (X iterations)
- Key task 1
- Key task 2

## Expected Outcomes
- Outcome 1
- Outcome 2
- Outcome 3

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | Strategy |
| Risk 2 | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | Strategy |

## Conclusion
Summary of the proposal and its benefits.

**Status**: In Discussion
```

## Proposal States

| Symbol | State | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 🔵 | In Discussion | Proposal is being actively reviewed and discussed |
| 🟡 | Approved | Proposal has been approved but not yet implemented |
| 🟢 | Implemented | Proposal has been successfully implemented |
| 🔴 | Rejected | Proposal was rejected after review |

## Directory Structure

Proposals are organized by development cycle:

```
dev-proposals/
├── cycle-1.0.1/         # Development Cycle 1.0.1
│   ├── pip-001-xxx.md
│   └── pip-002-xxx.md
├── cycle-1.1.1/         # Development Cycle 1.1.1
│   └── pip-003-xxx.md
└── cycle-1.2.1/         # Development Cycle 1.2.1
    ├── pip-004-xxx.md
    └── ...
```

## Creating a New Proposal

1. Determine the appropriate cycle for your proposal
2. Create a new markdown file with the naming convention: `pip-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
3. Use the template above as your starting point
4. Fill in all sections with detailed information
5. Submit for review

## Best Practices

- Be specific about the problem being solved
- Include diagrams for complex systems or workflows
- Consider potential risks and provide mitigation strategies
- Break implementation into manageable phases with realistic timelines
- Reference related proposals or dependencies
