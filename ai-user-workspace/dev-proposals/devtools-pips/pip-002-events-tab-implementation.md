# PIP-002: Events Tab Implementation and Event Debugging
=========================================================================

**State**: 🔵 In Discussion
**Cycle ID**: 1.0.3
**Impacts**: DevTools, EventSystem

## Problem Statement
The Events tab is mentioned in the DevTools UI but not implemented. There's currently no way to monitor, debug, or trigger events in the engine during runtime. This makes it difficult to understand event flow, diagnose event-related issues, and test event-driven behaviors in the portfolio engine.

## Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive Events tab that:
1. Shows a chronological event log of all fired events in the system
2. Allows manual triggering of events for testing purposes
3. Provides filtering and search of events by type, target, and parameters
4. Visualizes event flow and propagation through the entity hierarchy
5. Enables setting breakpoints on specific event types for debugging

## Technical Approach
Implement an event monitoring system that integrates with the existing EventSystem:

```ascii
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Event Capture  ├────►│  Event Storage  ├────►│  Event Display  │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        │                       │                       │
        ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│ Event Injection │     │Event Breakpoints│     │  Event Filters  │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

Key components of the implementation:

1. **Event Monitoring System**:
   - Hook into EventSystem to capture all events as they're dispatched
   - Store events with timestamps, types, targets, and parameter data
   - Implement configurable buffer size to prevent memory issues

2. **Event Log UI**:
   - Chronological display of events with filtering options
   - Color-coding for different event types/priorities
   - Expandable event details to show full parameter data
   - Search and filter functionality

3. **Event Trigger Interface**:
   - Form-based interface for constructing custom events
   - Parameter editor with type checking
   - Target entity selector
   - Ability to save event templates for reuse

4. **Event Flow Visualization**:
   - Real-time visualization of event propagation
   - Entity highlight when receiving events
   - System highlight when processing events
   - Connection lines showing event paths

5. **Event Debugging Tools**:
   - Breakpoint setting on specific event types
   - Pause engine when breakpoint is hit
   - Inspect full event context when paused
   - Step through event handlers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Event Logging and Basic Display (1 iteration)
- Implement event capture hooks in EventSystem
- Create event storage with buffer management
- Design and implement the Events tab UI with basic log display
- Add simple filtering and search functionality
- Implement real-time updating of event log

### Phase 2: Event Triggering Interface (1 iteration)
- Create the manual event construction interface
- Implement parameter editing with appropriate input controls
- Add target entity selection from hierarchy
- Build event dispatch mechanism
- Add event template saving and loading

### Phase 3: Event Flow Visualization (1 iteration)
- Design and implement the event flow visualization UI
- Create entity-to-entity connection rendering
- Add real-time highlighting of event flow
- Implement system involvement visualization
- Add event path tracing

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete implementation of the Events tab in DevTools
- Improved visibility into the event system's operation
- Enhanced debugging capabilities for event-related issues
- Ability to test event-driven behaviors through manual triggering
- Better understanding of event flow and propagation
- Reduced development time for event-driven features

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance overhead from event logging | High | Medium | Implement selective logging and configurable buffer sizes |
| Complexity in visualizing event flow | Medium | High | Start with simple visualization and iterate based on user feedback |
| Event system modification requirements | Medium | Medium | Design for minimal invasiveness with extension points rather than modifications |
| Memory leaks from stored event data | High | Low | Implement proper cleanup and circular buffer with configurable size |
| Synchronization issues with engine state | Medium | Medium | Use proper locking/synchronization mechanisms when accessing shared data |

## Conclusion
The Events tab implementation will significantly enhance the DevTools' debugging capabilities for event-driven aspects of the portfolio engine. By providing comprehensive tools for monitoring, triggering, and visualizing events, developers will gain better insights into the system's behavior, leading to faster issue resolution and more robust event handling.
