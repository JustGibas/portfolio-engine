# PIP-004: Entity Query System in DevTools
=========================================================================

**State**: 🔵 In Discussion
**Cycle ID**: 1.0.3
**Impacts**: DevTools, EntityManager

## Problem Statement
Finding specific entities in the engine is currently limited to basic search functionality. There's no way to query entities based on their components, properties, or relationships, making it difficult to identify and debug specific entity configurations in complex scenes. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of the DevTools for diagnosing entity-related issues.

## Proposed Solution
Add an advanced entity query system to the Entities tab that:
1. Allows filtering entities by component presence/absence
2. Supports querying by component property values
3. Enables saving and loading common queries
4. Shows query results in real-time as the engine runs
5. Provides visual grouping of related entities

## Technical Approach
Implement a comprehensive query system that extends the existing Entities tab:

```ascii
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Query Builder  ├────►│  Query Engine   ├────►│  Results View   │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        │                       │                       │
        ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Query Library  │     │  Real-time      │     │  Entity         │
│  & Presets      │     │  Monitoring     │     │  Grouping       │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

Key components of the implementation:

1. **Query Builder Interface**:
   - Component type selector with auto-completion
   - Property path builder with type checking
   - Comparison operators (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
   - Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, NOT)
   - Query syntax highlighting and validation

2. **Query Execution Engine**:
   - Fast entity filtering based on component presence
   - Property value comparison with type coercion
   - Query optimization for performance
   - Result caching for repeated queries
   - Integration with EntityManager for efficient entity access

3. **Results Display**:
   - Tabular view with customizable columns
   - Grid view with entity previews
   - List view with detailed information
   - Sorting and secondary filtering
   - Export functionality for query results

4. **Query Management**:
   - Save queries as named presets
   - Query categorization and organization
   - Import/export of query libraries
   - Query history tracking

5. **Live Monitoring**:
   - Real-time updates as entities change
   - Change highlighting in query results
   - Auto-refresh with configurable frequency
   - Persistent queries across sessions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Query System Implementation (1 iteration)
- Design and implement the query language specification
- Create the query builder UI with component and property selection
- Implement the core query execution engine
- Add basic results view with entity display
- Integrate with existing entity inspection functionality

### Phase 2: Advanced Querying and Presets (1 iteration)
- Add complex query operators and advanced filtering
- Implement query preset saving and management
- Create real-time query monitoring
- Add visual entity grouping in results
- Implement query performance optimization
- Add export functionality for query results

## Expected Outcomes
- Powerful entity filtering and discovery capabilities
- Faster debugging of entity configuration issues
- Better insight into entity relationships and patterns
- More efficient testing of entity-based features
- Improved developer workflow for entity management
- Support for more complex entity debugging scenarios

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Query performance with large entity counts | High | Medium | Implement query optimization and result caching |
| Complex query UI overwhelming users | Medium | Medium | Progressive disclosure, presets, and contextual help |
| Query accuracy with dynamic entity changes | High | Low | Implement proper synchronization with entity changes |
| Integration complexity with existing entity view | Medium | Low | Modular design with clear interfaces between components |
| Memory usage for complex query results | Medium | Low | Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading of entity details |

## Conclusion
The Entity Query System will significantly enhance the DevTools' capability to find, filter, and inspect entities based on their components and properties. This functionality will streamline debugging, testing, and development workflows, allowing developers to easily identify and work with specific entity configurations in the portfolio engine.
